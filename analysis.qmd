### Popularity of female baby names from 1950 to 2020
```{r}
#| label: fig-line-girls
#| fig-cap: "Line plot displaying proportion of top 10 girl names by year"
get_most_frequent(babynames, select_sex = "F") |>
  plot_top()
```

@fig-line-girls shows that some female names had picks of popularity

### Popularity of female baby names from 1950 to 2020
```{r}
#| label: fig-line-boys
#| fig-cap: "Line plot displaying proportion of top 10 boy names by year"
get_most_frequent(babynames, select_sex = "M") |>
  plot_top()
```

@fig-line-boys shows that names that were popular before 1990 are relatively infrequent after 2000.
